# PL/SQL Employee Performance Management System

## Project Overview

This project is a bonus calculator built with PL/SQL for Oracle Database. It is built on top of Oracle's built in HR Schema.
This project calculates employee bonuses based on performance grades recorded for a specific time period.
It uses two main sources of information:
*   **`hr.employees`** - Contains employee details .
*   **`hr.performance_reviews`** - A new table created in this project to store performance grades.

This project demonstrates::
* PL/SQL procedure development
* Business rule implementation using conditional logic
* Table relationships with foreign keys
* Performance based bonus automation

## Database Component

We created one new table to hold the performance information.

**`hr.performance_reviews`**

This table stores employee review data including:

* Employee reference
* Review period
* Performance grade
* Manager comments


Here's the Script used to create it:
```sql
CREATE TABLE hr.performance_reviews (
    review_id        NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id      NUMBER REFERENCES hr.employees(employee_id),
    review_period    DATE,
    performance_grade CHAR(1),
    comments         VARCHAR2(100)
);
```

Data is:
* Extracted from `hr.employees`
* Joined with `hr.performance_reviews`
* Processed using PL/SQL logic
* Used to generate calculated bonus output

## Tools Used

*   **Oracle Database:** 
*   **Oracle HR Schema:** 
*   **PL/SQL:**
*   **TOAD for Oracle:**

The entire project was developed using PL/SQL inside TOAD connected to Oracle Database utilizing the HR schema

## Procedure Overview: `generate_performance`

All the bonus logic is inside a reusable PL/SQL procedure called:

**`generate_performance`**

The procedure explained:
1.  **Input:** Accepts a review period date as a parameter
2.  **Data Gathering:** It pulls employee salaries from the `employees` table and their grades for that date from the `performance_reviews` table.
3.  **Logic:** It looks at each employee's grade and decides the bonus percentage.
4.  **Calculation:** It multiplies the employee's salary by that percentage to get the final bonus amount.
5.  **Output:** It prints the results for you to see.

## Bonus calculation

Bonus percentages are assigned based on performance grade:

* **A → 20% bonus**
* **B → 10% bonus**
* **C → 5% bonus**
* **D → 2% bonus**
* **Any other grade → 0% bonus**
.

**Formula:**
```
Bonus Amount = Employee's Salary × Bonus Percentage
```

The PL/SQL code uses `IF / ELSIF` statements to apply these rules.

## How to Set It Up and Use It

### Step 1: Requirements

*   An Oracle Database, with the HR sample schema already installed.
*   A tool to run SQL and PL/SQL, like TOAD, SQL Developer, or similar.
*   Permission to create new tables and procedures in the database.

### Step 2: Create Custom Table

Run the `CREATE TABLE` script for `hr.performance_reviews` (provided above) in your database tool.

### Step 3: Add Some Performance Data

You need to put some sample data into the new table. This is like entering the "report cards" for a few employees.

Here's an example of how to add data:
```sql
INSERT INTO hr.performance_reviews (employee_id, review_period, performance_grade, comments)
VALUES (101, TO_DATE('2026-02-01','YYYY-MM-DD'), 'A', 'Outstanding leadership');

INSERT INTO hr.performance_reviews (employee_id, review_period, performance_grade, comments)
VALUES (102, TO_DATE('2026-02-01','YYYY-MM-DD'), 'B', 'Strong performance overall');

INSERT INTO hr.performance_reviews (employee_id, review_period, performance_grade, comments)
VALUES (103, TO_DATE('2026-02-01','YYYY-MM-DD'), 'D', 'Needs improvement');
```

### Step 4: Create the Procedure

Copy the code for the `generate_performance` procedure and run it in your database tool to compile it. Make sure there are no errors.

### Step 5: Execute Procedure

Run the procedure for a specific review date:
```sql
BEGIN
   -- Replace 'YYYY-MM-DD' with the actual date, like '2026-02-01'
   generate_performance(DATE 'YYYY-MM-DD');
END;
/
```

This will evaluate employees for the given review period and output calculated bonus results.

*   **Handling errors gracefully:** Making the code smarter so it doesn't crash if, for example, an employee's data is missing.
*   **Creating summary reports:** Writing another procedure to show total bonuses by department.
*   **Building a dashboard:** Connecting the data to a tool like Oracle APEX or Power BI to create a visual report.
