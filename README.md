# PL/SQL-Employee-Performance-Management-System

---

## Project Overview

The **PL/SQL-Employee-Performance-Management-System** is a PL/SQL-based project built on top of Oracle's built-in HR Schema. The system calculates employee bonuses based on performance grades recorded for specific review periods.

It uses data from:

* `hr.employees`
* `hr.performance_reviews`

This project demonstrates:

* PL/SQL procedure development
* Business rule implementation using conditional logic
* Table relationships with foreign keys
* Performance-based bonus automation
* Integration with Oracle HR sample schema

The system evaluates employee performance grades and automatically calculates bonus amounts based on predefined percentage rules.

## Database Component

A custom table was created for this project:

`hr.performance_reviews`

This table stores employee review data including:

* Employee reference
* Review period
* Performance grade
* Manager comments

```sql
CREATE TABLE hr.performance_reviews (
    review_id        NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id      NUMBER REFERENCES hr.employees(employee_id),
    review_period    DATE,
    performance_grade CHAR(1),
    comments         VARCHAR2(100)
);
```

Data is:

* Extracted from `hr.employees`
* Joined with `hr.performance_reviews`
* Processed using PL/SQL logic
* Used to generate calculated bonus output

This simulates a simplified employee performance and compensation evaluation system used in corporate HR departments.

---

## Technologies Used

* Oracle Database
* Oracle HR Sample Schema
* PL/SQL
* TOAD for Oracle

The entire project was developed using PL/SQL inside TOAD connected to Oracle Database utilizing the HR schema.

## Procedure Overview: `generate_performance`

All bonus calculation logic is implemented inside a reusable PL/SQL stored procedure named:

`generate_performance`

The procedure:

* Accepts a review period date as a parameter
* Joins `hr.employees` with `hr.performance_reviews`
* Evaluates employee performance grades
* Calculates bonus percentage using conditional logic
* Computes final bonus amount using employee salary

---

## Bonus Calculation Logic

Bonus percentages are assigned based on performance grade:

* **A → 20% bonus**
* **B → 10% bonus**
* **C → 5% bonus**
* **D → 2% bonus**
* **Any other grade → 0% bonus**

**Bonus Formula:**

```
Bonus = Salary × Bonus Percentage
```

This logic is implemented using `IF / ELSIF` conditions inside the procedure.

## Installation / How to Use

### Step 1: Requirements

* Oracle Database installed
* Access to the HR sample schema
* TOAD for Oracle (or any PL/SQL IDE)
* Privileges to create tables and procedures

---

### Step 2: Create Custom Table

Run the `performance_reviews` table creation script.

---

### Step 3: Insert Performance Data

Insert employee performance records with:

* Valid `employee_id`
* Valid `review_period` date
* Appropriate `performance_grade`
* Script used for this project:
```
INSERT INTO hr.performance_reviews (employee_id, review_period, performance_grade, comments)
VALUES (101, TO_DATE('2026-02-01','YYYY-MM-DD'), 'A', 'Outstanding leadership');

INSERT INTO hr.performance_reviews (employee_id, review_period, performance_grade, comments)
VALUES (102, TO_DATE('2026-02-01','YYYY-MM-DD'), 'B', 'Strong performance overall');

INSERT INTO hr.performance_reviews (employee_id, review_period, performance_grade, comments)
VALUES (103, TO_DATE('2026-02-01','YYYY-MM-DD'), 'D', 'Needs improvement');
```
---

### Step 4: Compile Procedure

Compile the `generate_performance` procedure in your Oracle environment.

Ensure there are no compilation errors.

---

### Step 5: Execute Procedure

Enable server output:

```sql
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
```

Then execute the procedure for a specific review period:

```sql
BEGIN
   generate_performance(DATE 'YYYY-MM-DD');
END;
/
```

This will evaluate employees for the given review period and output calculated bonus results.

## Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:

* PL/SQL stored procedure development
* Conditional business rule implementation
* Table creation with foreign key constraints
* Data processing using `JOIN` operations
* Parameter-based procedure execution
* Integration with Oracle HR schema

---

## Future Improvements

* Store calculated bonuses in a dedicated `bonus_history` table
* Add validation for duplicate review periods
* Implement exception handling for missing data
* Create reporting procedure for department-wise bonus analysis
* Integrate with Oracle APEX or Power BI for visualization
